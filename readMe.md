# Mariokart Randomizer

## Live Demo
To try this Mariokart 8 Randomizer, please visit [www.malte-budig.de/mariokart](www.malte-budig.de/mariokart). 🎮🔀

## Goal
The goal of this project is to add more fun to Mariokart 8 gameplay. 🌟 After playing for some time, I found myself always selecting the same combination of characters and vehicle parts, which became repetitive. To address this, I created this website to provide myself and others with the opportunity to experience new combinations. 🔄🎌

## Technologies Used
For this project, I used React and Tailwind CSS, along with the open-source component library [shardcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), to create the user interface. The website is designed to be mobile-friendly, so feel free to check it out on your mobile device! 📱✨

I am grateful to [@Aerofolio](https://github.com/Aerofolio) for creating their version of a [randomizer](https://github.com/Aerofolio/MK8Random) which provided the assets, saving me the trouble of collecting all the necessary icons. 🙏🎨

I attempted to host this project in a Docker container with an NGINX service serving the build files. While it worked, the server on which I am running my website already has an NGINX service running, so I decided to deploy the files there instead. 🐳🖥️

## To Be Continued
In the future, I plan to add the option to filter available characters and vehicle parts. Additionally, I may include other Mariokart games and possibly an option to save or lock specific combinations. 🎨🔍💾

I hope you enjoy using the Mariokart Randomizer! Have fun and may the best racer win! 🏁🥇🌟
